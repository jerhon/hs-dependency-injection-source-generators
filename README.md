# Honlsoft.DependencyInjection.SourceGenerators

This is a project to test out creating a source generator in Roslyn.
Thhis project was meant to auto generate Factories for classes with constructors attributed with a `[Factory]` attribute.
The source generator would auto implement this Factory.


## Example

I have a unit test that demonstrates this.


```csharp
[Test]
public void TestExecutionOfSimpleFactory() 
{
    IInstanceClassFactory factory = new InstanceClassFactory(new InjectedClass());
    var testClass = factory.Create("Factory");
    Assert.AreEqual("Factory Injected!", testClass.ToString());
}
```

Where the class that the factory is autogenerated for is here:

```csharp
public class InjectedClass {
    public override string ToString() {
        return "Injected!";
    }
}

public class InstanceClass {

    private readonly string _regularParameter;
    private readonly InjectedClass _injectedParameter;
    
    [Factory]
    public InstanceClass(string regularParameter, [Inject]InjectedClass injectedClass) {
        _regularParameter = regularParameter;
        _injectedParameter = injectedClass;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"{_regularParameter} {_injectedParameter}";
    }
}
```

I want to use the Factory pattern in order to create a class which has some constructor parameters which are dependencies that would be injected by say an DI container, and the others are not available until runtime.


## Problems

* While my source generator is working when I do a full compile, when I edit in visual studio and/or Rider I will start getting errors that the interface and class I have defined for the .
* Debugging is clunky, and I haven't found an easy way to output log/debug/trace information from my source generator.

### ISourceGenerator should not have shared variables

Originally I had limited success.

While I was able to generate a factory, the editing experience in Rider and Visual Studio isn't working to my satisfaction.
Full builds and rebuilds of the solution would work fine.  However, editing in the project would cause the generated source to be lost and I would start getting errors that the generated factories don't exist.

These could be issues with my source generator, but I need to investigate it further.

Reading through this a common problem is having a shared field or property across execution runs: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/49249
The intent is that every time execute is run, it should not share state as it can be run multi-threaded!

## TODO

If I can figure out the problem above, there are several todos:
* Cleanup - this was a try it out kind of project, and the code base could be a little cleaner
* Need to copy namespaces over for parameters that are used in the generated files.  If a parameter comes from another namespace a using directive is required.
* Need to deal with namespaces on the factory classes to match the class better.
  * deal with nested classes
  * deal with nested namespaces
